## Hi there I'm Zurnon  

I'm a 16-year-old from Canada who started my coding journey in February 2025.  
After taking a Python introductory course in high school, I quickly developed a strong passion for coding, and now I aspire to become a software developer/engineer one day.  

### What I'm up to
- Diving deeper into programming language theory — how languages talk to computers and how they compile/interpret.  
- Exploring and practicing with my favorite languages: **C++** and **Python**.  
- Building projects and experimenting with new ideas.  

### 🛠Tools I enjoy
- **VS Code**  
- **Notion**  
- **Git & GitHub**  

### Looking for
- Collaboration opportunities  
- Connecting with other developers  
- Learning and growing through teamwork
